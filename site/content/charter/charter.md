### 3.	TSC Voting

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **a.**	While it is the goal of the Project to operate as a consensus based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move forward, the Committers shall vote on a one vote per Committer basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **b.**	Quorum for TSC meetings shall require two-thirds of all Committers. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but shall be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **b.**	All participants shall encourage open participation from any organization able to meet the participation requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the community shall not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirements, or reasons other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all participants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **a.**	The TSC shall adopt a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory Project code-of-conduct, with approval from The Linux Foundation as outlined below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **b.**	The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **c.**	The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status will be made open and easily visible to all.

### 6.	Budget and Funding

The G&A fee shall equal 9% of the Project’s first $1,000,000 of gross receipts and 6% of the Project’s gross receipts over $1,000,000.
