<p> This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of,
the SNAS Project (the “Project”) within The Linux Foundation. Contributors to the Project must comply with the
terms of the Charter as well as any applicable policies of The Linux Foundation. </p>

 
### 1.	Mission of the Project

#### *The mission of the Project is to:*

1. Provide network routing topologies for software defined (e.g. NFV) applications
1. Evolve network management and automation to include realtime network routing topologies and changes within those topologies over time 
1. Enable Internet researchers and data sciences by providing quality and reliable Internet routing data 
1. Evolve network routing data collection to be real-time and streaming based utilizing streaming analytics to identify changes, perform de-duplication, and data enrichment 

### 2.	Technical Steering Committee

1. The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") shall be responsible for technical oversight of the Project.
1. The Technical Steering Committee voting members shall consist of the Project’s Committers. The Committers of the Project will be published in the Project repository (https://github.com/snasio).

    ##### **Committers**: *Contributors who have the ability to commit directly to a project’s main branch or repository on a SNAS project.*

1. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and/or Committer is open to all under the terms of this Charter.
1. The TSC may
    ##### **(1)** establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects,

The G&A fee shall equal 9% of the Project’s first $1,000,000 of gross receipts and 6% of the Project’s gross receipts over $1,000,000.
