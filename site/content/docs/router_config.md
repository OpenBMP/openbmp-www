Router Configurations
=====================
Below are some various example router configurations. 


IOS XE 3.12.0/15.4.2 (or greater)

JunOS 13.3 (or greater)
-----------------------
Link to vendor docs: [JunOS](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos13.3/topics/task/configuration/bgp-monitoring-protocol-v3.html)

```
routing-options {
    bmp {
        station BMPServer1 {
            initiation-message "Development/LAB";
            local-address 172.20.160.24;
            connection-mode active;
            monitor enable;
            route-monitoring {
                pre-policy;
            }
            station-address 10.20.254.245;
            station-port 5000;
            statistics-timeout 300;
        }
    }
```


IOS XE/XR Policy Refresh Note
--------------------------------
Pre-Policy updates currently require a refresh to be sent to each monitored
peer when the BMP server connection is established.  

In a stable environment the BMP Server connection is persistent and does
not go up and down. 

Stopping the BMP server or breaking the connectivity/access to the BMP server can 
result in reconnections.  Reconnection/flapping is controlled by various/configurable 
timers/delays. 
 
When the BMP session is initially established or reconnected, IOS XE/XR will send a refresh
to monitored peers one at a time.  Spacing a delay between each peer can be done by
configuring the **initial-delay** parameter.   The default is to wait 30 seconds 
between each peer.  
 
Other options exist for this command, including the ability
to skip the refresh altogether, which basically disables initial router table dump on
BMP server connection.  In the case of **skip** only incremental updates will be sent, 
but at any time the **admin/operator** can **initiate a bgp refresh on-demand**, which 
will in turn forward all BGP UPDATES to the BMP server (full pre-policy dump).
