The main architectural components of the SNAS framework are:  
  
A high speed, low foot print collector, a high performance message bus, consumer applications, database, APIs and user applications

## Flow

SNAS streams data from the network using a high performance collector. 
    The collector produces the parsed (and raw) BMP data to Kafka message bus 
    using a customizable topic structure.

Consumer applications can access to data using regular Kafka APIs.
    One of these consumers is called mysql-consumer and is responsible for
    storing the data in a mysql/mariadb database. Applications can access
    the data in the database either using the RESTful API or natively.
